# Studemeter: Emotion and Cognitive Load Detection System

![Project Logo](./assets/images/studemeter-logo.svg)

## Introduction

Studemeter aims to revolutionize the educational landscape by 
introducing an innovative system for detecting emotions and cognitive 
load in students. 
We use advanced technologies such as embedded systems, internet of things,
signal processing, and machine learning, 
to provides educators with a comprehensive tool to monitor students' 
emotional states, attention levels, and academic struggles in real-time.

At its core, Studemeter seeks to bridge the gap between educators and students 
by offering insights into students' well-being and learning experiences.
By understanding how students feel, educators can make a supportive 
learning environment.

## Problem Statement
### Challenges Faced by Educators
Educators encounter challenges in understanding students' emotional states and 
cognitive load due to:
- Variability in cognitive load among students makes assessment challenging.
- Limited resources hinder personalized support for students.
- Some educators may overlook the importance of addressing emotional well-being.

### Importance of Addressing These Challenges
Addressing these challenges is crucial for:
- Tailored interventions based on accurate insights lead to improved academic 
  performance and well-being.
- Recognizing and addressing diverse student needs fosters a more inclusive 
  learning environment.
- Integrating these strategies improves student motivation and engagement.
